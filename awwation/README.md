# Awwation

A web app for creating zooming presentations, similar to Prezi, but in HTML5.

## Info

Awwation is an app that allows you to create Prezi-like presentations in the browser. Presentations are SVG files that are animated using Javascript. 

The editor is built upon the core of [SVG-edit](http://svg-edit.googlecode.com), and uses the [Sozi](http://sozi.baierouge.fr/wiki/en:welcome) library for zooming animations.

## Running

You can run Awwation by simply placing it behind a static site server, such as a stock Apache installation.

Try the live branch hosted via GitHub pages at [http://awwation.com](http://awwation.com), or see below.

### Example steps

1. Navigate to your server's root directory (`/var/www` by default in Ubuntu, under Apache)  
`cd /var/www`
2. Clone it off GitHub:  
`git clone https://adityab@github.com/adityab/Awwation.git`
3. Point your browser to `http://localhost/Awwation/editor/` to launch the presentation editor.
